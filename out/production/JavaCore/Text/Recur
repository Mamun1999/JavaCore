Function calling: When a function is calling and working on its procedure in that meantime it is staying in stack memory
until it finishes its working.
if we do not use base condition then
 recursive function will print value and call itself then print value then again call itself and in very time it will take space int the stack memory.
  when stack will fill then we will get a stackoverflow error.

     Stack
     --------
     print(3)  3     nothing left so finish and leave from stack 3->X
     --------

     --------
     print(2)  2     2->X
     --------

     --------
     print(1)  1     3->x
     --------
     --------
     main()    start  4->X
